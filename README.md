A small cli helping to sync chia full nodes.

## Download

## Why did I write this command line tool?

My full node was stuck syncing and I saw that every full node I'm connected to
is behind me in height.
This happens quite frequently to me since the original software does not balance
connections as it seems.

## What does it do?

This program ensures that no more than half the full nodes we are connected to
are behind us in sync height.

Options:

- specify a height tolerance to allow nodes being behind (default 5000 blocks)
- run indefinitely every X seconds

## Improvement Ideas

- [ ] Installation script for cron job use-case
- [ ] Use chia API instead of cli
- [x] Allow a healthy balance of nodes being behind and nodes being further than us
